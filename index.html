        <p>A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website.
        They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.</p>

                <p>A web developer will use codes on the site to make it function and run smoothly. It is the most crucial step in development as the graphic design in the previous stage comes to life. As per sitemaps, a home page is first designed than the other pages. Here, you can finally start making the website.</p>
